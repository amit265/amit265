## Hi there 👋 I am Amit.

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into the world of React and loving every bit of it!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full stack web development projects, especially those involving React and Node.js.

🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced JavaScript concepts and best practices in full stack development.

💬 Ask me about my experience in building Android apps or my journey in full stack web development.

📫 How to reach me: amitk.kumar414@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I started coding by creating simple app on my Android phone.

🎉 When I’m not coding, you can find me fixing home appliances, exploring the great outdoors, playing with kids, cooking, or getting lost in a good book on my Kindle.
